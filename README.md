# LVRDM
LabVIEW Repos Dependency Manager (LVRDM)

## Inspiration
Inpsired from Java Spring-boot and Python pip-installation, this project aims at reducing the complexity in managing dependencies for LabVIEW project.  Idea is to have a dependency file that dictates where to find all public repositories for dependency and pull the source or binaries from such repos.
